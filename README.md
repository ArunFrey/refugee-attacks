# Visualising anti-refugee attacks across Germany

This repository does two things:

1. It contains code to download and store each instance of anti-refugee violence gathered by the Amadeu-Antonio-Foundation and PRO ASYL on the [Mut Gegen Rechte Gewalt Portal](https://www.mut-gegen-rechte-gewalt.de/service/chronik-vorfaelle?&&field_date_value%5Bvalue%5D%5Byear%5D=2017&page=0).

2. It generates a dashboard visualising these attacks across Germany and over time.

To download the data, run:

`python -m arvig`

To run the dashboard, run:

`python -m app`
